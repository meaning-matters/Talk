- Later: orderByConversation (use predicate of fetchedMessagesController + test performance)

- All number-formats must be checked, in the entire app. What the app works with + how it is displayed to the user.
- What happens with special cases such as "WeChat" etc?

- All cancels for webrequests.

- Searching contacts crashes the app when typing specific letters or numbers .....

- Handle webrequest errors etc.

- When selecting text in a message, the blue dot (the last one always, the first one only when moving) is not drawn outside of the bubble.
- The edit/delete/etc menu is not always in the right place (try clicking somehwere after selecting text and you'll see)
- No way to remove selection

- Clicking in a chat should close the keyboard but this is only done when clicking between the bubbles (and the bubbles are internally the whole screen width ... )

- Change icon (both sides are cut of 1 or 2 pixels)

- [FIXED?] InputToolbar appears too late (maybe because of loading the messages first?)

- When openening a long chat, first it's scrolled to the top, then to the bottom (not everything loaded or something??)

- Messages jump when going into a conversations. This has to do with jumping to the first unread message.

- A conversation without contactId (and contactname) is updated when this is added to contacts. But when this contact is removed the name stays there (same happens on recents). Is that ok?

- Replace all underscores in property-names on server-side as well, then change DataManager that there are no underscores anymore.

- Replace all alertcontrollers with BlockAlertView

- Clean up functions in webclient + server.

- See CDRs API: There should be just one method. Selection between all or from a date should be done in the same way as done for CDRs. Ergo, we don't want a separate API to get all message.
