* Check what happens when user switches SIM (e.g. BE -> NL).  Both when ReadFromSIM is on
  and off.  Integrate this behaviour with alerts given to user when he calls first local
  number.  Also find better place for code in viewWillAppear of SettingsViewController.

* Fix country names (e.g. Venezuela, Vietnam, ...).
