* Check what happens when user switches SIM (e.g. BE -> NL).  Both when ReadFromSIM is on
  and off.  Integrate this behaviour with alerts given to user when he calls first local
  number.  Also find better place for code in viewWillAppear of SettingsViewController.

* Netherlands Antilles flag not correct, must have 5 instead of 6 stars.

* MobileCountryCodes.json has duplicate keys (e.g. 340), so can't be stored in NSDictionary!  App needs to display choice for ISO country, when MCC has more than one.

# NOTE: The SIP info (username, password, ...) saved in keychain, can only be read back when app is build with same Apple provisioning profile!!!
