* Check what happens when user switches SIM (e.g. BE -> NL).  Both when ReadFromSIM is on
  and off.  Integrate this behaviour with alerts given to user when he calls first local
  number.  Also find better place for code in viewWillAppear of SettingsViewController.

* Remove countries from Settings -> Home Country list, that are not known as MCC.

* MobileCountryCodes.json has duplicate keys (e.g. 340), so can't be stored in NSDictionary!  App needs to display choice for ISO country, when MCC has more than one.
