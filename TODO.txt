* Check what happens when user switches SIM (e.g. BE -> NL).  Both when ReadFromSIM is on
  and off.  Integrate this behaviour with alerts given to user when he calls first local
  number.  Also find better place for code in viewWillAppear of SettingsViewController.

* Netherlands Antilles flag not correct, must have 5 instead of 6 stars.

* MobileCountryCodes.json has duplicate keys (e.g. 340), so can't be stored in NSDictionary!  App needs to display choice for ISO country, when MCC has more than one.

# NOTE: The SIP info (username, password, ...) saved in keychain, can only be read back when app is build with same Apple provisioning profile!!!

* NetworkStatus only recognises WISPr captive portals when checked host does not return
  the expected data.  Also support other types, or make more general and assume captive
  portal when host does not return expected data (latter is tricky because bad connection
  may also have unexpected data).
  
* Use special new textfield with format in ForwardingVC.

* Revisit "canceled" (iOS preferred?) vs. "cancelled" (current in app, also used in
  AFNetworking, so don't change these!).
  
* Bug in Notes op iPhone.  Probably old table cell mix up.

* When account and verified number: Check if checkWarnedAboutDefaultCli is properly working.

* Check all code if @"" and string.length > 0 are used instead of (string != nil), or the other way around!!!

* Check that VC Cancels stop activity as much as possible.

* verplaats ook activity indicators on Number Verif. View (provisioning)
