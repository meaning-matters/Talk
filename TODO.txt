* Check what happens when user switches SIM (e.g. BE -> NL).  Both when ReadFromSIM is on
  and off.  Integrate this behaviour with alerts given to user when he calls first local
  number.  Also find better place for code in viewWillAppear of SettingsViewController.

* Netherlands Antilles flag not correct, must have 5 instead of 6 stars.

* MobileCountryCodes.json has duplicate keys (e.g. 340), so can't be stored in NSDictionary!  App needs 
  to display choice for ISO country, when MCC has more than one.

# NOTE: The SIP info (username, password, ...) saved in keychain, can only be read back when app is 
  build with same Apple provisioning profile!!!

* NetworkStatus only recognises WISPr captive portals when checked host does not return
  the expected data.  Also support other types, or make more general and assume captive
  portal when host does not return expected data (latter is tricky because bad connection
  may also have unexpected data).
  
* Use special new textfield with format in ForwardingVC.

* Revisit "canceled" (iOS preferred?) vs. "cancelled" (current in app, also used in
  AFNetworking, so don't change these!).
  
* Bug in Notes op iPhone.  Probably old table cell mix up.

* When account and verified number: Check if checkWarnedAboutDefaultCli is properly working.

* Check that VC Cancels stop activity as much as possible.

* Check waarom alert over Allow Data Calls soms 3 keer komt (na app provisioning).

* Check waarom Davy my op api2 zit als ik hier api1 kiest.

* Check waarom call direct na prov. niet lukt.  Ook lukken calls sowieso soms niet.

* Zag "Nothing to Restore" terwijl er wel een account was.  Zijn er andere errors misschien die nu op een hoop
  worden geveegd?
  
* Zag dit, zonder ISO: postPath request: https://api.numberbay.com/users?currencyCode= 
  Was waarschijnlijk van niet wachten op loadProducts completion.

* Maak één grote Strings.m met daarin alle strings. Groepering onder Common, Provisioning, .... en dan functies
  provisioningInvalidNumberTitle:, met als key @"Privisioning:InvalidNumberTitle".
  
* Technical error: 32004?

* Add Helps item about audio quality + the nature of internet connections.

* Rename homeCountry to homeIsoCountryCode ?  (Settings)

* Check if Common checkCountryOfPhoneNumber is not broken by changes for CountriesVC zie breakpoint

* Create CountryTableCell that takes a iSO country code and use in SettingsVC and NumberAreaVC ...

* Test how currencyCode to #8B can be empty, right after provisioning.  Perhaps order problem with loading products?

* Make sure that credit & number purchases are handled correctly when they are pushed by App Store later, i.e.
  without the UI (for example at app kill/crash/error between payment OK, and processing on server).  The
  productCompletion will/should be nil then.
  
* Rename WebClient methods to simpler prefixes: Get, Buy, ... (instead fo retrieve, purchase, ...).

* Sort PurchaseManager methods in REST.txt order.

* Check what happens when notifications are of, buyAccount in PurchaseManager.

* Do all tables using http://stackoverflow.com/a/18418549/1971013

* Make number duration images softer (no black borders), and make them 37x37 ipv 38x38.

* Think about if it's really good to cancel the who buy VC when Store alert is cancelled, as is done now.

* Add PurchaseManager loadProducts to Number/Credit Buy, with error alerts and busy indication while loading. Or use
  notification sent by PurchaseMgr.

* In WebClient return NSError with webClientFail code and localized string, as id content (call it object?); in case of error.

* Rewrite WebClient status texts. localizedStringForStatus

* Gooi Help teksten in RTFs?

* Add a badge to Credit tab when below tier 5. 

* Add warning push notification from server when credit gets below tier 5.

* Order delegate methods in same way accross .m files (e.g. table view delegates).

* Place common methods (textfield & keyboard handling) between NumberAreaVC, NumberVC, ForwardingsVC and others in super class.

* Implement Number[s]VC with NSFetchResultsController (see Forwarding[s]VC).

* Als #2 faalt, mislukt Restore silently: zorg dat er een melding komt. kijk ook na voor #1 e.d.

* als je nummer koop cancelt wordt deze toegevoegd als pending!

* Differentiate between real WebClient network problem, and API problem.

* Introduce NumberArea object to encapsulate exceptions of fields yes/no present and other logic (e.g to/from JSON).

* Warn users about expiring numbers.  Warn when number has expired. (Warn user when synchronize from server returns less numbers.)

* "Validate" is deselected after Closing alert, in other parts of the UI the button is immediately deselected when there's an alert; make same

* Make sure all cancelAll WebClient methods are used when cancelling stuff in the UI or otherwise appropriately.

* Wait for Store products to have loaded, because otherwise Currency is not available, and #1 fails.

* Use NSError everywhere, instead of WebClientStatus values here and there.
* Use NSError's localizedRecoverySuggestion instead of "Please try again later."
* Do: [NSError errorWithDomain:FSMyAppErrorDomain code:FSProfileParsingFailedError userInfo:@{NSLocalizedDescriptionKey : FS_ERROR_LOCALIZED_DESCRIPTION(error.code)}]; –
  en haal message uit error met userInfo[NSLocalizedDescriptionKey];

* Use capitalized Forwardings and Numbers, .... in texts?  currently use "Forwardings" & "numbers" -> inconsistent

* Replace DTMF keepalive with something else that always works.

* Only start sip when account, check restarts

* Make NSString properties copy, instead of strong:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/387959/nsstring-property-copy-or-retain
