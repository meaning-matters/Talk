  { "Account" : "<b>Get Started</b><br/>An anonymous account is created when you buy your initial credit; no personal information is required to use the service. Your phone number is verified, but only because it is necessary for making calls (see the Calls section).<br/><br/><b>Other Devices</b><br/>Once you have created your account, you can share it with any number of other iOS devices by tapping 'Restore' on the 'Get Started' screen. This requires you to be signed-in to the same iTunes & App Store account.<br/><br/><b>Data Sync</b><br/>Account data is not automatically shared between devices yet. When you make a change (e.g. rename one of your Phones) on one device, you need to do a refresh on your other devices to see the change. To refresh, simply drag down the list of Phones, or tap 'Synchronize With Server' on the Settings screen. Each device maintains its own call history, settings, and contacts caller ID selections; so this data is not shared between devices.<br/><br/><b>Reset All</b><br/>To wipe your account and all related data from an iOS device, tap 'Reset All' on the Settings screen. This will erase all app data except for your Contacts.<br/><br/><b>Never Expires</b><br/>There are no recurring costs and your balance never expires.<br/>" },
  
  { "Caller ID" :"<b>Control & Freedom</b><br/>NumberBay gives you full control over which Caller ID is shown to the person you call. You can choose any of your verified Phones as Caller ID, indepently from the phone you're being called back on. You can for example be abroad, have a local SIM card installed in your iPhone, but still show your office' phone number as Caller ID.<br/><br/><b>Virtual Multi-SIM</b><br/>Having a list of Phones is a bit like having multiple SIM cards in your iPhone, which allow you to switch number very easily.<br/><br/><b>Bring Your Own Device</b><br/>A rapidly increasing number of companies allow their employees to use their own mobile devices; a trend abbreviated with BYOD (Bring You Own Device). There are however problems when employees make calls to customers using their personal number: confusing for a customer to be called from an unknown mobile number, no separation between private and business calls, and a unclear telephone presence for the company. NumberBay solves this by simply enabling each employee to add the company's main telephone number in their list of Phones, after which the employee can use it as the Caller ID when calling customers.<br/><br/><b>Default Identity</b><br/>The app has a default Caller ID which is selected on the Settings screen. This is used for calls made from the dialer, and by default for calls to a contact.<br/><br/><b>Assigning To Contacts</b><br/>To make sure you always show the same Caller ID to a contact, you can assign a different verified Phone to each of your contacts. Go to Info screen of a contact. When you tap on 'Caller ID' you see your list of Phones. A simple tap on one of the Phones in the list assigns it to that contact. To delete an existing Caller ID assignment and use the default again, tap on the waste bin at the top-right of the Caller ID screen. An assigned Caller ID overrules the default from the Settings screen, also when calling that contact from Recents or from the Dialer (by entering the number).<br/><br/><b>Hide Your Caller ID</b><br/>You have the option to hide your Caller ID by simply flipping the 'Sohw My Caller ID' switch. You can set this as the default on the Settings screen, or for each contact individually (see the Assigning To Contacts paragraph above)." },
  
  { "Callback" : "<b>Not VoIP</b><br/>Many telephony apps pass audio over the Internet using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This is called Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and while usually cheaper than conventional mobile calls, comes at the cost of unstable audio quality and more frequently dropped calls.<br/><br/><b>Why Callback</b><br/>NumberBay uses Callback instead of VoIP to deliver good audio quality with a good user experience. Using Callback, even a slow Internet connection is sufficient to initiate a call, leaving our servers to establish your connnection over conventional telephony channels.<br/><br/><b>How It Works</b><br/>When you initiate a call, the NumberBay app sends a short message (around 0.0001MB) to our servers using a secured Internet connection. This message contains your Callback number, the number of the other person, your Caller ID, and whether or not your Caller ID will be shown to the other person. On receipt of this message, the NumberBay servers call your phone. When you answer, the NumberBay servers call the other person: the Callthru. When they answer, our servers join the two calls together and your dialog begins. The call ends when either of you hang up.<br/><br/><b>Data Usage</b><br/>Where Callback is to a different phone, the NumberBay app remains in the foreground and makes short status requests of the servers every second to report call status and to indicate call end. This leads to a data usage of about 0.1% of a typical VoIP call. When initiating and receiving the Callback on the same phone, the app is backgrounded, this eliminates status requests, and results in a negligible data usage.<br/><br/><b>Cost</b><br/>The total cost is the sum of both Callback and Callthru calls. Our wholesale call rates allow us to use two physical calls to establish your connection at a competitive cost to you.<br/>" },
  
  { "Calls" : "<b>Rates</b><br/>With NumberBay you make international calls at very competitive rates using quality telephone connections.<br/><br/><b>Charges</b><br/>NumberBay has eliminated the complexity of bundles, and charges all calls per second.<br/><br/><b>Two Calls</b><br/>NumberBay makes two calls, one from our servers to your phone: Callback, and the other from our servers to the other person: Callthru. Charges for the Callback start when you answer the call, so there will be small charge should you cancel the connection before the other person answers.<br/><br/><b>Mobile Charges</b><br/>In some countries (e.g. the USA) mobile operators charge for incoming calls, though usually receiving calls incurs no charge. However, while abroad using your home SIM card, roaming charges are applied, so Callbacks will cost.<br/><br/><b>Caller ID</b><br/>On the Settings screen you select which of your phone numbers should be used as the default Caller ID and which as your Callback number. The people you call will only see the selected Caller ID, and never the Callback number. Therefore, you can safely use any Callback number without the people you call knowing which phone you're actually using.<br/>" },
  
  { "Phones" : "<b>Phone Numbers</b><br/>When creating an account, you must supply one phone number. However, this need not be the number of the phone running the NumberBay app. It can be the number of any other phone that you use: a fixed line at home, your office number, the number of another mobile, a prepaid SIM card you buy abroad, or any other option you can imagine. Your iOS device's name is used as the initial name for this first phone number, but you can change this later.<br/><br/><b>iPod Touch & iPad</b><br/>As Callbacks can go to any phone, you don't require an iPhone to use NumberBay. Managing numbers and initiating calls can be done from any iOS device.<br/><br/><b>More Phones</b><br/>To help you keep track of the various phones you use, the NumberBay app keeps them in a list and allows you to give each one a name.<br/><br/><b>Adding Phones</b><br/>To add a phone, tap the [+] button on the Phones screen, then follow the same steps as when you started using NumberBay. You can add as many phones as you like.<br/><br/><b>Deleting Phones</b><br/>When you no longer have or use a phone, simply delete it from the list. You can only delete phones not currently used for Callback or Caller ID. A popup will appear when you try to delete a phone that is in use.<br/>" },
  
  { "Credit" : "<b>When Used</b><br/>Each account has a single credit balance that is used when you make NumberBay calls from any of your associated iOS devices. Credit is consumed by both the Callback and Callthru calls.  Callback charging starts when you answer the Callback. The Callthru charging starts when the other person or their voicemail answers.<br/><br/><b>Never Expires</b><br/>Purchased credit never expires and there is no recurring charge for having a NumberBay account.<br/><br/><b>Call Rates List</b><br/>On the Credit screen you find the Call Rates for all countries. This shows the minimum total per minute prices for fixed-line and mobile calls. If you tap on a rate, you will see the cost breakdown between Callback and Callthru.<br/><br/><b>Many Different Call Rates</b><br/>For each of about 200 countries there are thousands of call rates, each applying to a different number prefix. Most network providers publish a single fixed-line and single mobile rate for each country. We take a more fair approach and apply charges in line with our wholesale costs for each number you call.<br/><br/><b>Best Prices</b><br/>To keep the Rates screen simple, we only show the best/lowest prices per country and this is (close) the price you will actually pay in most cases. The exceptions typically are from particular network operators that sell low-charge mobile SIM cards but heavily charge calls to those numbers.<br/><br/><b>Actual Call Rate</b><br/>The actual rate of a given number can be found by entering it into the Dialler screen. The real price per minute you'll pay, will appear in the info line above the number. This requires a functioning Internet connection as the specific call rate is requested from our servers. This price also appears in the same place on the in-call screen for review at the start of each call you make.<br/>" },
  
  { "Settings" :"<b>Simplicity</b><br/>We have eliminated most of the complexity that is usually found in so many other telephony apps, so the NumberBay app has very few settings.<br/><br/><b>Phone You're Called On</b><br/>With Callback you select the phone on which the NumberBay servers call you.<br/><br/><b>Default Identity</b><br/>The Caller ID is the number that other people will see when you call them. If you don't want people to see your Caller ID, switch off Show My Caller ID.<br/><br/><b>Home Country</b><br/>The Home Country determines how local numbers (i.e. without country prefix) are interpreted. For example, if you call 01234567890 with the United Kingdom as the Home Country, you'll actually be calling +44 1234 567890. If your iOS device has a SIM card, the Home Country is determined from the limited information provided by iOS. However, you can override the Home Country by disabling 'Read From SIM' and selecting from the list. The 'Read From SIM' option does not appear if there is no SIM in your device.<br/><br/><b>Account Data</b><br/>If no NumberBay account is active, you see the 'Get Started' button which you can tap to begin the process of buying your initial credit, or restoring an existing account. By tapping 'Reset All', you can wipe your account, credit, call history, list of phones, and all settings from your iOS device. This does not delete your list of verified phones or credit from our servers, where they are safely kept. This feature can be used if you no longer use this device, or if you want to use another NumberBay account via a different iTunes & App Store account.<br/>" },
  
  { "Privacy" : "<b>Number Verification</b><br/>Most countries require a way to identify the origin of calls for situations where people misbehave. So, for legal reasons, all of the phone numbers you wish to use for Callback or Caller ID must be verified. Verification is also required to prevent the unauthorised use of phone numbers as Caller IDs.<br/><br/><b>Supplying Information</b><br/>Information will only be shared in response to a police/court order of which we can reasonably verify that it's not in conflict with privacy laws, nor with human rights. As NumberBay does not record calls, the only information available would be verified numbers and call detail records that show when and what numbers were called.<br/><br/><b>Statistics</b><br/>To improve our service, we carry out statistical analysis on which countries (and cities) are being called, and whether fixed-line or mobile phones were used. In future we may profile average calling behaviour of many accounts, to get a better understanding of how our service is used. However, all resulting data will be anonymised.<br/><br/><b>Technical Maintenance</b><br/>On rare occasions, short random sections of calls may be heard by one of our engineers for technical reasons only; for example to verify audio quality of calls to specific destinations. This is something that is impossible to avoid for any telecom company, so we choose to be open about it.<br/><br/><b>Data Storage</b><br/>All data (phone numbers, call detail records, and account data) is stored on secured servers. We do not have backdoors via which individuals, governments, or organisations could peek. Neither do we share any data with any other party or individual.<br/><br/><b>User Credentials</b><br/>Internally used security tokens are stored in a safe way on the iOS device, and are not easily accessible.<br/><br/><b>Secure Connections</b><br/>All communication between the app and our servers uses secure connections, so nobody can just tap the data and simply read the exchange between the app and our servers. Calling is safe even on public Wi-Fi networks. As we don't use VoIP; only phone numbers and status information is transfered over the Internet. However, while the technologies we use are proven to be extremely secure, no company can ever provide a 100% guarantee.<br/><br/><b>Other Systems</b><br/>Note that the audio data of your calls passes through regular (mobile) telephony systems over which we have no control. This means that your NumberBay calls are as secure as conventional phone calls." }
