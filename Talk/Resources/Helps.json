  { "Account" : "<b>Get Started</b><br/>An anonymous account is created when you buy your initial credit. Your phone number is verified only because it is necessary for making calls.<br/><br/><b>Other Devices</b><br/>You can share your account on all your iOS devices by tapping 'Restore' on the 'Get Started' screen. This requires you to be signed-in to the same iTunes & App Store account.<br/><br/><b>Data Sync</b><br/>Account data is not immediately synchronized between devices yet. When you make a change (e.g. rename one of your Phones) on one device, you need to do a refresh on your other devices to see the change. To refresh, simply drag down the list of Phones, or tap 'Synchronize With Server' on the Settings screen. Each device maintains its own outgoing call history, settings, and contacts caller ID selections; this data is not shared between devices.<br/><br/><b>Reset All</b><br/>To wipe your account and all related data from an iOS device, tap 'Reset All' on the Settings screen. You can always restore your account on any iOS device.<br/><br/><b>Never Expires</b><br/>There are no recurring costs. Your account and Credit never expire.<br/>" },

  { "Numbers" : "<b>Extra Number</b><br/>With NumberBay you can have a second telephone number, or as many you need. Tap the + button on the Numbers screen and follow the easy steps.<br/><br/><b>Many Countries</b><br/>You can choose from 60 countries. We supply local numbers in thousands of cities, mobile numbers, national number, and toll-free numbers. Coverage differs per country, but we continuously add available types, cities, and regularly countries.<br/><br/><b>Quality</b><br/>Because we want your phone to just always work, we've deliberately chosen a most reputable supplier in the world. Your Number(s) will be connected directly to the main telephony network in its country.<br/><br/><b>Regulations</b><br/>In each country specific regulations apply, which we, as a professional company, need to obey. For example, some countries only allow residents to use local numbers. For all countries it's required that you supply your name and address.<br/><br/><b>Receiving Calls</b><br/>When someone calls you, the call will be forwarded to a Destination. At the moment a Destination is just forwarding the call to one of your verified Phones. We plan to add more advanced Destinations soon (e.g., multiple Phones where the first one that picks up gets the call).<br/><br/><b>Caller ID</b><br/>When you make a call, you can use your Number as Caller ID. You can select a Number as your default Caller ID in Settings, or, you can assign it as Caller ID for specific contacts on each contact details screen.<br/><br/><b>Credit Usage</b><br/>When someone calls you, our servers forward the call to one of your Phones (using a Destination). This forwarding is a real telephone call for which you'll be charged. The cost per second depends on the Phone you use to receive these calls. You can find the per-minute rates in your list of Destinations. As the actual rates are requested from our servers, an internet connection is needed to see them." },

  { "Caller ID" :"<b>Control & Freedom</b><br/>NumberBay gives you full control over which Caller ID is shown to the person you call. You can choose any of your verified Phones and purchased Numbers as Caller ID. Your Caller ID is totally independent from the Phone you're being called back on. You can for example be abroad, have a local SIM card installed in your iPhone, but still show your office' phone number as Caller ID.<br/><br/><b>Bring Your Own Device</b><br/>A rapidly increasing number of companies allow their employees to use their own mobile devices; a trend abbreviated with BYOD (Bring You Own Device). There are however challenges with employees making calls to customers using their personal number: confusing for a customer to be called from an unknown mobile number, no separation between private and business calls, and an unclear telephone presence for the company. NumberBay helps resolve those challenges by enabling each employee to add the company's main telephone number in their list of Phones, after which the employee can use it as the Caller ID when calling customers.<br/><br/><b>Virtual Multi-SIM</b><br/>Having a list of Phones is a bit like having multiple SIM cards in your iPhone. This allows you to switch number very easily. Note that NumberBay does not support a full-circle Multi-SIM experience, because that would include receiving calls on the number shown as Caller ID.<br/><br/><b>Default Identity</b><br/>The app has a default Caller ID which is selected on the Settings screen. This is used for calls made from the Keypad, and by default for calls to a contact.<br/><br/><b>Assigning To Contacts</b><br/>To make sure you always show the same Caller ID to a contact, you can assign one of your verified Phones to each of your contacts. Go to the Info screen of a contact. When you tap on 'Caller ID' you see your list of Phones. A simple tap on one of the Phones in the list assigns it to that contact. To delete an existing Caller ID assignment and use the default again, tap on the waste bin at the top-right of the Caller ID screen. An assigned Caller ID overrules the default from the Settings screen. Also when calling a contact from Recents or from the Keypad (by entering the number) the assigned Caller ID will be used.<br/><br/><b>Hide Your Caller ID</b><br/>You have the option to hide your Caller ID. You can set this as the default on the Settings screen by simply flipping the 'Show My Caller ID' switch, or for each contact individually using the 'Hide My Caller ID' switch (see Assigning To Contacts above)." },
  
  { "Callback" : "<b>Not VoIP</b><br/>Many telephony apps pass audio over the Internet using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This is called Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and while usually cheaper than conventional mobile calls, comes at the cost of unstable audio quality and more frequently dropped calls.<br/><br/><b>Why Callback</b><br/>NumberBay uses Callback instead of VoIP to deliver good audio quality with a good user experience. Using Callback, even a slow Internet connection is sufficient to initiate a call, leaving our servers to establish your connnection over conventional telephony channels.<br/><br/><b>How It Works</b><br/>When you initiate a call, the NumberBay app sends a short message (around 0.0001MB) to our servers using a secured Internet connection. This message contains your Callback number, the number of the other person, your Caller ID, and whether or not your Caller ID will be shown to the other person. On receipt of this message, the NumberBay servers call your phone. When you answer, the NumberBay servers call the other person: what we call the Callthru. When they answer, our servers join the two calls together and your dialog begins. The call ends when either of you hang up; just like a regular phone call.<br/><br/><b>Data Usage</b><br/>When the Callback is received on a different phone, the NumberBay app remains in the foreground and makes short status requests to our servers every second to report call status and to indicate call end. This leads to a small data usage of about 0.1% of a typical VoIP call. When initiating and receiving the Callback on the same iPhone, the app is backgrounded, this eliminates status requests, and results in a negligible data usage.<br/><br/><b>Cost</b><br/>The total cost is the sum of both Callback and Callthru calls. Our wholesale call rates allow us to use two physical calls, still at a competitive price for you.<br/>" },
  
  { "Calls" : "<b>Rates</b><br/>With NumberBay you make international calls at very competitive rates using quality telephone connections.<br/><br/><b>Charges</b><br/>NumberBay has eliminated the complexity of bundles, and simply charges all calls per second.<br/><br/><b>Two Calls</b><br/>NumberBay makes two calls, one from our servers to your phone: Callback, and the other from our servers to the other person: Callthru. Charges for the Callback start when you answer the call, so there will be small charge should you cancel the connection before the other person answers.<br/><br/><b>Mobile Charges</b><br/>In some countries (e.g. the USA) mobile operators charge for incoming calls, though usually receiving calls incurs no charge. However, while abroad using your home SIM card, roaming charges are applied, so Callbacks will cost.<br/><br/><b>Callback Abroad</b><br/>Receiving mobile calls is much cheaper than making a mobile call in most countries. For that reason, Callback can give you consirable cost savings while still using your home SIM while abroad.<br/><br/><b>Caller ID</b><br/>On the Settings screen you select which of your phone numbers should be used as the default Caller ID and which as your Callback number. The people you call will only see the selected Caller ID, and never the Callback number. Therefore, you can safely use any Callback number without the people you call knowing which phone you're actually using.<br/>" },
  
  { "Phones" : "<b>Phone Numbers</b><br/>When creating an account, you're asked to verify one phone number. However, this need not be the number of the phone running the NumberBay app. It can be the number of any other phone that you use: a fixed-line at home, your office number, the number of another mobile, a prepaid SIM card you buy abroad, or any other option you can imagine. Your iOS device's name is used as the initial name for this first phone number, but you can change this later.<br/><br/><b>iPod Touch & iPad</b><br/>As Callbacks can go to any phone, you don't require an iPhone to use NumberBay. Managing numbers and initiating calls can be done from any internet connected iOS device.<br/><br/><b>More Phones</b><br/>To help you keep track of the various phones you use, the NumberBay app keeps them in a list and allows you to give each one a name.<br/><br/><b>Adding Phones</b><br/>To add a phone, tap the [+] button on the Phones screen, then follow the same steps as when you started using NumberBay. You can add as many phones as you like.<br/><br/><b>Deleting Phones</b><br/>When you no longer have or use a phone, simply delete it from the list. You can only delete phones not currently used for Callback or as Caller ID. A popup will appear when you try to delete a phone that is in use.<br/>" },
  
  { "Credit" : "<b>When Used</b><br/>Each account has a single calling credit that is used when you make NumberBay calls from any of your associated iOS devices. Credit is consumed by both the Callback and Callthru calls.  Callback charging starts when you answer the Callback. The Callthru charging starts when the other person or their voicemail answers.<br/><br/><b>Never Expires</b><br/>Purchased credit never expires and there is no recurring charge for having a NumberBay account.<br/><br/><b>Call Rates List</b><br/>On the Credit screen you find the Call Rates for all countries. This shows the minimum total per minute prices for fixed-line and mobile calls. If you tap on a rate, you will see the cost breakdown between Callback and Callthru.<br/><br/><b>Many Different Call Rates</b><br/>For each of about 200 countries there are often hundreds of call rates, each applying to a different number prefix. Most network providers publish/charge a single fixed-line and single mobile rate for each country. We take a more fair approach and apply charges in line with our wholesale costs for each number you call.<br/><br/><b>Best Prices</b><br/>To keep the Rates screen simple, we only show the best/lowest prices per country and this is (close) the price you will actually pay in most cases. The exceptions typically are from particular network operators that sell low-charge mobile SIM cards but heavily charge calls to those numbers.<br/><br/><b>Actual Call Rate</b><br/>The actual rate of a number can be found by entering it on the Keypad screen. The real price per minute you'll pay, will appear in the info line above the number. (This price also appears in the same place on the in-call screen for review at the start of each call you make.) Also, each contact's Info screen displays the rate behind each of the numbers. The up-to-date rates are retrieved from our servers; therefore a functioning Internet connection is required.<br/><br/><b>Callback Rate</b><br/>The total costs of a call is the sum of costs for the Callback and Callthru calls. By using a fixed-line instead of a mobile for Callback, can help you keep your calling costs low.<br/><br/><b>Security</b><br/>Your credit balance is safely kept on our server, the app's Credit screen only shows the credit it retrieves from our servers. When you buy credit, the purchase is verified on our servers; only when all is clear and after your credit has been increased on our servers, will the purchase be confirmed to the App Store.<br/>" },
  
  { "Settings" :"<b>Simplicity</b><br/>We have eliminated most of the complexity that is found in too many other telephony apps. The NumberBay app has very few settings.<br/><br/><b>Phone You're Called On</b><br/>With Callback you select the phone on which the NumberBay servers call you.<br/><br/><b>Default Identity</b><br/>The 'Caller ID' is the number that other people will see when you call them. If you don't want people to see your Caller ID, switch off Show My Caller ID.<br/><br/><b>Home Country</b><br/>The Home Country determines how local numbers (i.e. without country prefix) are interpreted. For example, if you call 01234567890 with the United Kingdom as the Home Country, you'll actually be calling +44 1234 567890. If your iOS device has a SIM card, the Home Country is determined automatically (from the limited information provided by iOS). However, you can override the Home Country by disabling 'Read From SIM' and selecting from the list. The 'Read From SIM' option does not appear if there is no SIM in your device.<br/><br/><b>Account Data</b><br/>If no NumberBay account is active, you see the 'Get Started' button which you can tap to begin the process of buying your initial credit, or restoring an existing account. By tapping 'Reset All', you can wipe your account, credit, call history, list of Phones, contact Caller ID assignments, and all settings from your iOS device. This does never delete your list of verified Phones or credit from our servers, where they are safely kept. This feature can be used if you no longer use this device, or if you want to use another NumberBay account via a different iTunes & App Store account.<br/>" },
  
  { "Privacy" : "<b>Number Verification</b><br/>Most governments require a way to identify the origin of calls for situations where people misbehave. For that reason, all of the phone numbers you wish to use for Callback or Caller ID must be verified.<br/><br/><b>No Contacts Downloading</b><br/>We do not download your contacts to our server, like various other companies do. Our service works only with the bare telephone numbers. Matching telephone numbers to your contacts, on for example the Recents screen, is all done locally by the app.<br/><br/><b>Supplying Information</b><br/>Information will only be shared in response to a police/court order of which we can reasonably verify that it's not in conflict with privacy laws, nor with human rights. As NumberBay does not record calls, the only information available would be verified numbers and call detail records that show when and what numbers were called or were calling.<br/><br/><b>Statistics</b><br/>To improve our service, we may carry out statistical analysis, for example which countries were called most. All data will be anonymised.<br/><br/><b>Technical Maintenance</b><br/>On rare occasions, short random sections of calls may be heard by one of our engineers for technical reasons only. This is something that is impossible to avoid for any telecom company. We choose to be open about this.<br/><br/><b>Data Storage</b><br/>All data (e.g., your verified phone numbers, call detail records, and account data) is stored on secured servers at highly ranked cloud services companies. We do not have backdoors via which individuals, governments, or organisations could peek. Neither do we share data with any external party.<br/><br/><b>Account</b><br/>Your account's security tokens, that are used internally by the app, are stored in a safe way on the iOS device. They are not easily accessible, making it extremely difficult for someone to break into your account.<br/><br/><b>Secure Connections</b><br/>All communication between the app and our servers uses the highest level secure connections possible on iOS. Nobody can just tap the data and read the exchange between the app and our servers. Therefore, making calls is safe even on public Wi-Fi networks.<br/><br/><b>No VoIP</b><br/>As we don't use VoIP (Internet telephony over Wi-Fi or mobile data), only phone numbers and status information is transferred over the Internet between the app and our servers. The actual calls run over the good old mobile and fixed-line telephony networks. This means that your NumberBay calls are as secure as conventional phone calls." }
