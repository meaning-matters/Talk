 { "Resample" : "The first version of this software was written by Julius O. Smith III <jos@ccrma.stanford.edu> at CCRMA <http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu> in 1981.  It was called SRCONV and was written in SAIL for PDP-10compatible machines.  The algorithm was first published in:\n\nSmith, Julius O. and Phil Gossett. ``A Flexible Sampling-Rate Conversion Method,'' Proceedings (2): 19.4.1-19.4.4, IEEE Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, San Diego, March 1984.\n\nAn expanded tutorial based on this paper is available at the Digital Audio Resampling Home Page given above.\n\nCirca 1988, the SRCONV program was translated from SAIL to C by Christopher Lee Fraley working with Roger Dannenberg at CMU.\n\n Since then, the C version has been maintained by jos.\n\n Sndlib support was added 6/99 by John Gibson <jgg9c@virginia.edu>.\n\nThe resample program is free software distributed in accordance with the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL).
